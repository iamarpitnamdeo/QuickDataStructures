Spanning Tree 

A spanning tree is a subset of tree, in which all the vertex of tree (T) are present but it may no contain all the edges. 

  - Minimum Spanning Tree - It is weighted connected graph G is called a minimum spanning tree if it's weight is minimum. 

Algorithm to find minimum spanning tree 

1. Prims Algorithm 
2. Kruskal Algorithm 


	Prims Algorithm :-
	Steps :-
	1. Select the pair with minimum weight 
	2. Select the adjacent vertex and select he minimum weighted edge, using the adjacent vertex,
	   but it is very important that the selected adjacent vertex should not form the circuit. 

	3. Repeat step 1 and 2 until all the vertex are covered. 

		
	Kruskal algorithm :-

	Steps:-
	1. Select a pair with the minimum weight each time select adjacent vertex should not form circuit. 
	2. Repeat step1 until all steps are covered. 
	(here it is not important to select adjacent edge)



Shortest path:-
	Dijkstra's Algorithm 
	This algorithm suggest the shortest Parth from some source node to other destination node. 
	We start finding distance from the string node and find all the path from it to neighbouring nodes. 

	Than which ever is nearest node those Parth are selected 
	
	So the process of finding the nearest node is repeated till the end node so the path is called shortest path.

	P = set of already selected nodes
	T = Remaining nodes.

	


Hashing 
	- Open Hashing
	- Close Hashing

	1. Devision Method - in this method we use modern arithmetic system to divide the key value by some integer devisors it gives us the location where the element can be placed. 

	2. Mid Square Method - in this case we square the value of a key and takes the numbers of digits require to form an address from the middle position of squrare value. 

	3. Folding Method - in this method the keys portion inserts the no of parts and even parts having the same length.
