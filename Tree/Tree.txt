Spanning Tree 

A spanning tree is a subset of tree, in which all the vertex of tree (T) are present but it may no contain all the edges. 

  - Minimum Spanning Tree - It is weighted connected graph G is called a minimum spanning tree if it's weight is minimum. 

Algorithm to find minimum spanning tree 

1. Prims Algorithm 
2. Kruskal Algorithm 


	Prims Algorithm :-
	Steps :-
	1. Select the pair with minimum weight 
	2. Select the adjacent vertex and select he minimum weighted edge, using the adjacent vertex,
	   but it is very important that the selected adjacent vertex should not form the circuit. 

	3. Repeat step 1 and 2 until all the vertex are covered. 

		
	Kruskal algorithm :-

	Steps:-
	1. Select a pair with the minimum weight each time select adjacent vertex should not form circuit. 
	2. Repeat step1 until all steps are covered. 
	(here it is not important to select adjacent edge)



Shortest path:-
	Dijkstra's Algorithm 
	This algorithm suggest the shortest Parth from some source node to other destination node. 
	We start finding distance from the string node and find all the path from it to neighbouring nodes.
